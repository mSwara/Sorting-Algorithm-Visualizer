# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
### Project Overview

Developed a Visual Sorting Algorithm project that uses a graphical representation of the selection sort algorithm in C++. The project provides dynamic visual feedback during the sorting process, illustrating element swapping with color-coded lines in real-time. By shuffling data arrays randomly, you demonstrated the algorithm's performance on nearly sorted, reverse sorted, and random arrays, creating an interactive and visually engaging educational tool.

### Software Used

- **IDE:** Visual Studio:Blocks for writing and debugging C++ code.
- **Graphics Library:** BGI graphics library for rendering graphical elements.

### Objectives

1. **Create a Visual Representation of Selection Sort:**
   - Implement a graphical depiction of the selection sort algorithm.
2. **Provide Dynamic Visual Feedback:**
   - Use color-coded lines to show real-time element swapping during the sorting process.
3. **Demonstrate Algorithm Performance:**
   - Utilize random shuffling to display the algorithm's efficiency on different types of arrays (nearly sorted, reverse sorted, and random).
4. **Enhance Educational Tools:**
   - Offer an interactive and engaging way for users to learn and understand the selection sort algorithm.

### Learning Outcomes and New Implementations

- **Graphics Programming:** Gained experience using the BGI graphics library to create visual representations and animations in C++.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Implemented dynamic visual feedback with color-coded lines to illustrate the sorting steps in real-time.
- **Algorithm Performance Demonstration:** Used random shuffling of arrays to showcase the selection sort algorithm's performance on various array types.
- **Interactive Educational Tool:** Enhanced educational tools by providing a visually engaging method to understand the selection sort algorithm, making it easier for users to grasp the concept through interactive visualization.
